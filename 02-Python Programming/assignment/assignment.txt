There are 7 tasks

1) Create 2 jupyter notebooks and write a code to output the circumference of the circle in one notebook and another for a rectangle.


2.1) Solve the Python Data types Task
	1- Open code Folder.
	2- Open 01-Python Data types Folder.
	3- Open 10- Objects and Data Structures Assessment Test.ipynb notebook.
	

2.2) Solve the Python Files Task
	1- Open a file, name it 'test.txt' and write 'hello world' for 5 times in it then close it.
	2- Read the contents of the file, then make content in upercase then write the result again to the file.
	3- Read the third line of the file then capitalize it then append the result to the file.
	4- Using With Statement open this file and append 'I Love python' to it.


3) Solve the Python Statements Task
	1- Open code Folder.
	2- Open 02-Python Statements folder.
	3- Solve 05-Statements Assessment Test.ipynb file.


4) Solve the Functions Task
	1- Open code Folder.
	2- Open 03-Functions folder.
	3- Solve 02-Function Practice Exercises.ipynb file.
	4- Solve 06-Functions and Methods Homework.ipynb file.


5) Make project like with Thanos project data (50 images) to read all files and rename these files with random names.


6) Make 2 packages first one called Transformers and second one called Operations in StringTransformers make a module called StringOperations that has 2 functions one to reverse a string and second one to capitlize a string, and in the Operations package make one module called Math that has 2 functions min and max to get the min and max of list values, then make a notebook to sue those functions.


7) Make a project to calculate the sum of the prime numbers from 2 to 1000 with step of two.
	1- First make a list containing the prime numbers between 2 and 1000 and call it all_prime_numbers_list.
	2- Then make a new list call it two_steps_numbers_list extract only the 2 steps prime numbers from the all_prime_numbers_list and put them in the two_steps_numbers_list list. for example if I have a all_prime_numbers_list like this [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] then the resulting two_steps_numbers_list list is [1, 3, 5, 7].
	3- Calculate the sum of the numbers in two_steps_numbers_list list and output the value.
